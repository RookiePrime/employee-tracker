## Installation
To install this application, follow the below instructions:
    - First, install Node.js. It's a javascript engine that runs on your computer instead of the browser, and necessary for the application to function. This application was created on Node v14.17.1.
    - Second, clone/download this project from its GitHub repository to a directory of your choosing.
    - Third, open your terminal -- command line, powershell, et cetera -- and navigate to the directory into which you downloaded the application.
    - Fourth, enter the command 'npm i', which will download and install all of the necessary dependencies for the application to function.
    - Finally, enter the command 'npm start' to begin using the application!

## Usage
This application has limited functionality and a fairly restricted interface. It is primarily for use to read from and write to an employee database, and cannot be used beyond that scope without modification.
